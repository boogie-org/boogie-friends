;;; Commentary:

;; See boogie-friends.el for general information about this package.
;;
;; This file offers of a more sophisticated method for verifying buffers on the
;; fly than the original one. The checker defined in dafny-mode.el simply calls
;; the standard Dafny CLI for each change, reverifying the entire source file
;; every time. This is inefficient, especially when editing a few functions in a
;; larger file.
;;
;; This file implements a client for the Dafny server, a command line utility
;; that allows non-.Net editors to take advantage of Dafny's caching facilities,
;; as used by the Dafny extension for Visual Studio. The server is essentially a
;; REPL, which produces output in the same format as the Dafny CLI; clients thus
;; do not need to understand the internals of Dafny's caching. A typical editing
;; session proceeds as follows:
;;
;; * When a new Dafny file is opened, the editor starts a new instance of the
;;   Dafny server. The cache is blank at that point.
;; * The editor sends a copy of the buffer for initial verification. This takes
;;   some time, after which the server returns a list of errors.
;; * The user makes modifications; the editor periodically sends a new copy of
;;   the buffer's contents to the Dafny server, which quickly returns an updated
;;   list of errors.
;;
;; The client-server protocol is sequential, uses JSON, and works over ASCII
;; pipes by base64-encoding utf-8 queries. It defines one type of query, and two
;; types of responses:
;;
;; Queries are of the following form:
;;    verify
;;    <base64 encoded JSON payload>
;;    [[DAFNY-CLIENT: EOM]]
;;
;; Responses are of the following form:
;;    <list of errors and usual output, as produced by the Dafny CLI>
;;    [SUCCESS] [[DAFNY-SERVER: EOM]]
;; or
;;    <error message>
;;    [FAILURE] [[DAFNY-SERVER: EOM]]
;;
;; The JSON payload is an utf-8 encoded string resulting of the serialization of
;; a dictionary with 4 fields:
;;    * args:   An array of Dafny arguments, as passed to the Dafny CLI
;;    * source: A Dafny program, or the path to a Dafny source file.
;;    * sourceIsFile: A boolean indicating whether the 'source' argument is a
;;                    Dafny program or the path to one.
;;    * filename:     The name of the original source file, to be used in error
;;                    messages
;;
;; For small files, embedding the Dafny source directly into a message is
;; convenient; for larger files, however, it is generally better for performance
;; to write the source snapshot to a separate file, and to pass that to Dafny
;; by setting the 'sourceIsFile' flag to true.
